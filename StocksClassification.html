                    <h1>Stock Classification</h1>
                    <p>Since the beginning of the Era when Stock were initially introduced, until the present time, investing in stocks have been one of the most effective and efficient way for individuals, families and business to accumulate capital, build wealth, and grow their passive income. However, investing in stocks remain misunderstood by a clear majority of the investing population.<br><br>
                    Carefully chosen, the collection of stocks, can provide freedom from financial worry as well as flexibility to pursue your passion in your own time. Here’s what you need to know about investing in stocks.<br><br>
                    Stocks are sometimes called “securities” because they are, a type of financial security, or “equities”, because they represent ownership (equity) in a business.<br><br>
                    The “Classes of stock” may not be confused with “classes of shares.” Even though the two terms may be interchangeable when referring to company’s stock, the term “classes of shares” could also be referred to different classes of mutual fund shares.<br><br>
                    In the world of finance today, there is a little mix up between the definition of Stock and Shares. Both expressions are used to refer one’s ownership in a company. However, Stock is generally used to express the ownership in any company, or could be more than one company, whereas the “shares” is used for a company.<br><br>

                    Common stock is aptly named since it is the most common type of stock issued by a company. General when someone is buying a stock in a company on a major exchange, they are buying common shares of stock. Common stock shareholders have voting rights that allow them to select members of the board of directors and provide a voice in company policies. The holder of common stock also possess an ownership stake in the company. If the company has also issued preferred stock, common stockholders are placed in a secondary position when sharing in the company’s assets (i.e., after debt holders and preferred shareholders) in the event of liquidation or bankruptcy. Common stock ownership may come with other vested rights, such as preemptive rights (the right to maintain proportional ownership in the company in the event more stock shares are issued).<br><br>
                    Common stock is entitled to its proportionate share in a company’s profit or losses. Some companies, based on their policy, decides whether to share the profit from the company’s earning, with their shareholders of common stock, this is considered as Dividends.<br><br>
                    Several companies offer this, and some corporations do not share their profit with their stockholder of common stock. It is an important element to find out when buying or investing in a company as shareholder of common stock. However, the shareholders of common stock have voting privileges in the company.

                 For most companies issuing commons stock, there will only be one class of that common stock, with each share providing equal valuation and rights to every other share.

                 The value stocks tends to have low current to price earrings ration and low price to book ratios, compare to the Growth Stocks. Their Price-to-earn ratio is greater so as their book-to-price ratio. Investors are generally attracted to buy the value stock due to lower price structure. The value stock tends to grow faster if the market realizes their full potential providing an opportunity to the investor to get good returns on their investment, versus the growth stock, whose growth is steady but slow.<br><br>
                 Value stocks generally have low current price-to-earnings ratios and low price-to-book ratios. Investors buy these stocks in the hope that they will increase in value when the broader market recognizes their full potential, which should result in rising share prices. Thus, investors hope that if they buy these stocks at bargain prices and the stocks eventually increase in value, they could potentially make more money than if they had invested in higher-priced stocks that increased modestly in value.

                 The growth Stocks tend to have a high (P/E) price-to-earnings ratio and high price-to-book rations. The P/E ratio is the market value per share divided by the current year’s earnings per share. If the stock is currently trading at $26 per share and its earning over the last 12 months have been $2 per share, its P/E ratio would 13. The price-to-book ratio is the share price divided by the book value per share.<br><br>
                 The stocks of the companies whose growth is regarded as Aggressive or increasing rapidly are considered Growth Stocks. If a company is earning its annual net profits between 15% to 20% is pretty much under the frame work of Growth Stock. Depending on the market growth which at one time or other must slow down unless otherwise a diversification model is in talk, the rate of growth would probably be lower in the long run averaging between 10% and less.<br><br>
                 In general terms, some companies tend to spend more money on the Research and Development, especially the pharmaceutical companies to bring out the new products to capture additional market, resulting in less or no dividends payments to the stock holders, rather these companies reinvest all the profit in the growth and expansion of company. An example is internet-based companies who are more depended on development of advance technologies and software’s to capture larger audience. Their R&D budget are typically much high so as their growth and margin of profit. Since the potential is growth is evident with these companies so as the risk of greater fluctuation at times.

The general idea is earning a little more than the return on the bonds. This is also a simple way of having a modest life after retirement to earn a steady income, these investments carry lesser risk in the long run, due to outstanding performance of these well-established companies, rather than risking their investment in more aggressive companies.<br><br>
